- The category (e.g., carbs, protein)

- Whether it is perishable or not

- Create a new FoodItem object with the given information.
- Store it in the hash map.
- Insert its expiration date (along with its name and a unique ID) into the min-heap.

- Every time the app starts or the inventory is viewed:
-Get the current date.
- While the top item in the heap is expired:
- Remove it from the heap.
- Also remove it from the hash map.

4. Show Which Items Should Be Distributed Next
- When the user asks for items to distribute:
- Look through the heap without changing it.
- List all items that have not expired yet, starting with the earliest expiration dates.
- Return the list of food names in the right order.
