# Food Bank Management System
A simple, python-based program that makes use of data structures to create a food bank management system which helps food banks efficiently manage their food inventory and beneficiary profiles. This program tracks various food items, monitors expiration dates using a min-heap data structure, and supports matching donated food with beneficiaries' dietary needs to reduce food waste and improve distribution effectiveness.
